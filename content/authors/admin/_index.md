Hello, I'm Nikhil :) I'm passionate about utilizing data-driven insights to address complex economic challenges. With expertise in big data analytics, coding, and development, I am committed to leveraging technology for innovative solutions in economic research and decision-making. Rooted in a strong work ethic, I am dedicated to continual learning and improvement. Beyond my professional pursuits, I embrace a creative side - with love for composing music and playing the piano in my free time (check out my music below!). Equipped with a solid foundation in economic theory, empirical methods, and technical skills, I am eager to contribute to impactful initiatives that will shape the future of economics and beyond.
